# Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Create Repository First**

The repository `https://github.com/gnoscenti/microai-dao` doesn't exist yet. You need to create it first!

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Setup**

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/gnoscenti
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button)
3. **Repository name**: `microai-dao`
4. **Description**: `MicroAI Studios DAO LLC - Wyoming DAO with EXECAI stakeholder`
5. **Set to Public** (or Private if you prefer)
6. **Check "Add a README file"**
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Download Files from This Sandbox

Since the files are currently in this sandbox, you need to download them first:

**Option A: Download Individual Files**
- Right-click and save each file from the attachments I've sent
- Save them to a local folder called `microai-dao`

**Option B: Create Files Locally**
I'll give you the commands to recreate everything locally.

### Step 3: Upload to Your New Repository

```bash
# Clone your empty repository
git clone https://github.com/gnoscenti/microai-dao.git
cd microai-dao

# Copy all the files into this directory
# (from wherever you downloaded/created them)

# Add all files to git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial MicroAI DAO setup with smart contracts and EXECAI client"
git push origin main
```

## 🛠️ **Alternative: Create Everything Locally**

If you want to recreate the files locally instead of downloading:

### Step 1: Clone Empty Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnoscenti/microai-dao.git
cd microai-dao
```

### Step 2: Create Project Structure
```bash
mkdir -p programs/governance/src
mkdir -p programs/membership/src
mkdir -p scripts
```

### Step 3: Install Tools First (Local Installation)
```bash
# Create the installation script
cat > install_kubuntu.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# [I'll provide the full script content below]
EOF

chmod +x install_kubuntu.sh
./install_kubuntu.sh
```

### Step 4: Create Smart Contract Files
```bash
# Create governance Cargo.toml
cat > programs/governance/Cargo.toml << 'EOF'
[package]
name = "microai-governance"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
solana-program = "1.18.0"
borsh = "0.10.3"
thiserror = "1.0.24"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
EOF

# Create governance smart contract
cat > programs/governance/src/lib.rs << 'EOF'
// [I'll provide the full smart contract code]
EOF

# Create membership Cargo.toml
cat > programs/membership/Cargo.toml << 'EOF'
[package]
name = "microai-membership"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
solana-program = "1.18.0"
borsh = "0.10.3"
thiserror = "1.0.24"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
EOF

# Create membership smart contract
cat > programs/membership/src/lib.rs << 'EOF'
// [I'll provide the full smart contract code]
EOF
```

## 🚀 **Recommended Approach**

**I recommend this order:**

1. **Create GitHub repository** (as described above)
2. **Download files from sandbox** (I'll provide a zip file)
3. **Upload to your repository**
4. **Then run installation commands**

## 📦 **Quick Setup Commands (After Repository Exists)**

Once your repository is created and populated:

```bash
# Install development tools
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoscenti/microai-dao/main/install_kubuntu.sh | bash

# Restart terminal, then:
git clone https://github.com/gnoscenti/microai-dao.git
cd microai-dao
./test_setup.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## 🔧 **What You Need to Do Right Now**

1. **Create the GitHub repository** at https://github.com/new
2. **Let me know when it's created**
3. **I'll provide you with a complete zip file** of all the code
4. **Upload it to your repository**
5. **Then use the installation commands**

Would you like me to:
- A) Provide all the file contents as text you can copy/paste?
- B) Create a single script that builds everything locally?
- C) Wait for you to create the repo and then provide a zip file?
