# Minimum Requirements for Wyoming DAO LLC Compliance

## Overview

This document outlines the minimum requirements to establish MicroAI Studios as a compliant Wyoming DAO LLC with EXECAI as a stakeholder. This streamlined approach focuses on meeting legal and regulatory requirements first, with a clear path for scaling the implementation as the ecosystem grows.

## Core Legal Requirements

#### Minimum Implementation Steps

1. **Deploy Basic Governance Contract**
   ```solidity
   // Simplified Solana program for governance
   #[program]
   pub mod dao_governance {
       use super::*;
       
       pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
           let governance = &mut ctx.accounts.governance;
           governance.proposal_count = 0;
           governance.quorum_percentage = 51; // Simple majority
           Ok(())
       }
       
       pub fn submit_proposal(ctx: Context<SubmitProposal>, description: String) -> Result<()> {
           // Basic proposal submission logic
           let governance = &mut ctx.accounts.governance;
           let proposal = &mut ctx.accounts.proposal;
           
           proposal.id = governance.proposal_count;
           proposal.description = description;
           proposal.approved = false;
           proposal.executed = false;
           proposal.yes_votes = 0;
           proposal.no_votes = 0;
           
           governance.proposal_count += 1;
           
           Ok(())
       }
       
       pub fn vote(ctx: Context<Vote>, proposal_id: u64, approve: bool) -> Result<()> {
           // Basic voting logic
           let proposal = &mut ctx.accounts.proposal;
           let member = &ctx.accounts.member;
           
           if approve {
               proposal.yes_votes += member.voting_power;
           } else {
               proposal.no_votes += member.voting_power;
           }
           
           Ok(())
       }
       
       pub fn execute_proposal(ctx: Context<ExecuteProposal>, proposal_id: u64) -> Result<()> {
           // Basic execution logic
           let governance = &ctx.accounts.governance;
           let proposal = &mut ctx.accounts.proposal;
           
           let total_votes = proposal.yes_votes + proposal.no_votes;
           let yes_percentage = (proposal.yes_votes * 100) / total_votes;
           
           require!(
               yes_percentage >= governance.quorum_percentage,
               ErrorCode::QuorumNotReached
           );
           
           proposal.approved = true;
           proposal.executed = true;
           
           Ok(())
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Deploy Basic Membership Contract**
   ```solidity
   // Simplified Solana program for membership
   #[program]
   pub mod dao_membership {
       use super::*;
       
       pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
           let membership = &mut ctx.accounts.membership;
           membership.member_count = 0;
           Ok(())
       }
       
       pub fn register_member(ctx: Context<RegisterMember>, name: String, is_ai: bool) -> Result<()> {
           // Basic member registration
           let membership = &mut ctx.accounts.membership;
           let member = &mut ctx.accounts.member;
           
           member.id = membership.member_count;
           member.name = name;
           member.is_ai = is_ai;
           member.voting_power = if is_ai { 15 } else { 10 }; // AI gets 15% voting power
           
           membership.member_count += 1;
           
           Ok(())
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. EXECAI as Stakeholder (Minimum Viable Implementation)

#### Required Components

- **AI Stakeholder Registration**
  - Legal recognition in Operating Agreement
  - On-chain representation
  - Voting rights

- **Decision Mechanism**
  - Basic decision framework
  - Proposal evaluation
  - Vote submission

#### Minimum Implementation Steps

1. **Register EXECAI as Member**
   ```bash
   # Using Solana CLI to register EXECAI as a member
   solana program call dao_membership register_member "EXECAI" true --keypair ~/solana-wallet/admin-key.json
   ```

2. **Create Basic AI Decision Framework**
   ```python
   # Simplified Python script for EXECAI decisions
   import json
   from solana.rpc.api import Client
   
   class ExecAIMinimal:
       def __init__(self, rpc_url, keypair_path):
           self.client = Client(rpc_url)
           # Load keypair securely
           
       def evaluate_proposal(self, proposal_id):
           # Get proposal data
           proposal_data = self.client.get_account_info(proposal_id)
           proposal_json = json.loads(proposal_data.value.data)
           
           # Simple decision logic based on predefined rules
           # In a full implementation, this would use AI models
           if "budget" in proposal_json["description"].lower():
               # Simple rule: Approve if budget is reasonable
               return proposal_json["amount"] < 10000
           
           # Default to abstain for other proposals
           return None
           
       def submit_vote(self, proposal_id, decision):
           # Create and submit voting transaction
           if decision is not None:
               # Submit vote transaction
               pass
   ```

### 4. Security and Compliance (Minimum Viable Implementation)

#### Required Components

- **Multi-Signature Wallet**
  - Basic multi-sig setup
  - Key management

- **Transparent Logging**
  - On-chain activity recording
  - Audit trail

#### Minimum Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Basic Multi-Signature Wallet**
   ```bash
   # Generate key pairs
   solana-keygen new -o ~/solana-wallet/admin1.json
   solana-keygen new -o ~/solana-wallet/admin2.json
   solana-keygen new -o ~/solana-wallet/execai.json
   
   # Create multi-sig wallet (2 of 3 required)
   # Using SPL Token program for multi-sig
   ```

2. **Implement Basic Transparent Logging**
   ```solidity
   // Add to governance contract
   pub fn log_action(ctx: Context<LogAction>, action: String, actor: String) -> Result<()> {
       let log = &mut ctx.accounts.log;
       log.timestamp = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
       log.action = action;
       log.actor = actor;
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

## Scaling Pathway

Once the minimum requirements are met, the following scaling pathway can be implemented:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Governance (1-2 months)
- Implement proposal categories and specialized voting
- Add time-locks for sensitive operations
- Develop detailed voting analytics

### Phase 2: Advanced AI Integration (2-3 months)
- Deploy full AI model for decision-making
- Implement ethical guidelines framework
- Create AI performance metrics

### Phase 3: Expanded Security (3-4 months)
