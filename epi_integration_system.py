ETHICAL PROFITABILITY INDEX (EPI) INTEGRATION SYSTEM
===================================================
This system integrates the Ethical Profitability Index framework
into the EXECAI DAO governance system, ensuring all business decisions
are evaluated through both ethical and profitability lenses.

Features:
- Real-time EPI calculation for proposals
- Automated ethical assessment
- Profitability optimization
- Golden ratio balance point detection
- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Transparency scoring
- Sustainability metrics

Author: Manus AI
Based on: The Ethical Profitability Index (EPI) Mathematical Framework
