MicroAI DAO LLC – Investor Business
Blueprint
Executive
Summary
Company Overview: We propose establishing a Wyoming-registered Decentralized Autonomous
Organization LLC (“DAO LLC”) to develop personalized AI-embedded software applications. This
entity will leverage cutting-edge AI-driven governance to minimize traditional executive overhead,
allowing more capital to flow into innovation and growth. By automating routine management and
decision processes via smart contracts and AI, the DAO can significantly reduce administrative costs.
The savings will be reinvested into R&D and strategic acquisitions, fueling rapid scaling while also
returning value to stakeholders. The venture will partner with hardware providers to enable on-device
AI processing, ensuring our personalized AI apps run efficiently at the edge (on local devices) for
privacy, speed, and cost advantages.
Dual Financial Model: We will implement a dual financing mechanism to align incentives for all
participants. First, equity-based profit-sharing will reward venture capital investors with membership
interest (LLC equity) entitling them to profit distributions. Second, a token-based reward system will
incentivize early adopters, contributors, and those who reinvest returns with a governance/utility token.
This hybrid model allows traditional equity investors to benefit from the company’s profits and
growth, while community users and reinvesting supporters earn tokens that appreciate in value as the
ecosystem grows. All token issuances and trading will be handled in full compliance with U.S.
securities laws (e.g. Regulation D for private sales and potentially Regulation A+ for a broader
offering), ensuring legal soundness from day one.
Legal & Governance Structure: The company will be formed as a Wyoming DAO LLC, taking
advantage of Wyoming’s pioneering legislation explicitly recognizing DAOs as LLCs. This provides
the project with legal personhood, limited liability for members, and the ability to enforce governance
via smart contracts. The DAO’s Operating Agreement will designate an algorithmically-managed
governance system, where key decisions and operations are executed by smart contracts and AI agents
under member oversight. Wyoming law requires that any algorithmic management be upgradable and
include dispute resolution mechanisms, so our framework will incorporate safe upgrade paths (with
human/admin multisig approval for updates) and clear arbitration processes. A council or board of
advisors may be established to oversee critical matters and intervene if the AI governance fails or in
emergencies, ensuring a balance between automation and prudent human supervision. All foundational
legal documents (Operating Agreement, token offering disclosures, etc.) will be drafted to withstand
scrutiny by corporate attorneys and regulators, providing a solid legal bedrock for the venture.
Growth Strategy: Our market positioning centers on the convergence of AI and decentralization.
Personalized AI software (e.g. AI personal assistants, adaptive learning apps, customized enterprise AI
solutions) is an emerging high-growth sector – for instance, the on-device AI market alone is projected
to soar from ~$16.7 billion in 2023 to over $118 billion by 2031 (27.95% CAGR). We will
differentiate by offering privacy-preserving, real-time AI that runs locally on user devices in
partnership with hardware makers (leveraging specialized AI chips and neural processors). This
approach provides tangible benefits: increased productivity for users, improved data security, reduced
network costs, and low latency. By integrating our AI apps with hardware platforms, we aim to
become the default personalized AI solution on a range of devices, driving user adoption at scale. The

reduced overhead from our AI governance model means we can reinvest aggressively into product
improvement and user acquisition, outpacing more top-heavy competitors. In summary, this blueprint
details a forward-thinking business model that marries legal compliance, innovative governance, and
strategic market insight – a combination designed to attract venture capital, empower a community,
and achieve rapid yet sustainable growth.
Wyoming DAO LLC Structure and Legal Framework
Legal Entity Formation: The company will be organized as a Wyoming DAO LLC, taking advantage
of Wyoming’s DAO Supplement (2021) which allows blockchain-based organizations to register as
LLCs. This provides the venture with a legal identity and capacity to contract, while preserving the
decentralized ethos. Key legal features of the Wyoming DAO LLC structure include:
 Limited Liability & Legal Personhood: The DAO LLC is a legal entity separate from its
members, protecting individual investors and participants from personal liability for the DAO’s
debts or actions. Members’ risk is thus capped at their investment. The DAO can own property,
sign contracts, and even appear in court in its own name.
 Recognition of Smart Contracts: Wyoming explicitly permits a DAO LLC’s governance to be
defined by smart contracts and algorithmic processes rather than a traditional board of
managers. Our Operating Agreement will reference the on-chain governance contract as the
primary “operating system” of the company. Notably, Wyoming law acknowledges that
management “can occur algorithmically through smart contracts”, a significant departure from
conventional LLC management. In case of any conflict between the blockchain-based rules and
the written articles, the law upholds the primacy of the smart contract governance (as long as
it’s compliant with the DAO Supplement).
 Member-Managed or Algorithmically-Managed: We will designate the DAO as
algorithmically-managed in the Articles of Organization, to fully utilize autonomous
governance. In compliance with Wyoming requirements, the smart contract system will be
upgradeable – meaning there is a built-in mechanism to update/patch the code if needed. (This
ensures the DAO can adapt to bugs, security vulnerabilities, or changing needs, rather than
being irreversibly locked into an outdated code.) The law insists on this upgradability, so our
governance design will include an upgrade protocol (e.g. requiring a supermajority vote of
members or a specialized multisig council to approve any smart contract changes).
Additionally, the Articles/Operating Agreement will outline dispute resolution procedures
(such as binding arbitration or forum selection) as mandated, to handle any conflicts that the
smart contracts cannot adjudicate.
 Registered Agent and Public Filing: The DAO LLC will maintain a registered agent and office
in Wyoming as required, and include the suffix “DAO LLC” or “LAO” in its legal name to
signal its status. We will file the Wyoming DAO LLC Articles of Organization, including the
required public notice that the entity is a DAO and may be algorithmically managed. All smart
contract addresses governing the DAO may be provided in the filings or an online public
registry as appropriate for transparency.
 Operating Agreement: A comprehensive DAO Operating Agreement will be drafted to
complement the smart contract governance. This document (agreed to by all founding
members/investors) will specify the DAO’s purpose, the governance structure, roles and
responsibilities of participants, and the financial rights of members. It will clearly delineate the
two classes of participants: Members (equity holders) and Token holders (community
participants). Members (such as VCs and founders) will likely be official LLC members with
ownership units (possibly represented by NFTs or tokens) that confer economic and voting

rights in proportion to their stake. Early adopters and community users who hold the reward
tokens might not be formal LLC members, but will have governance influence through token
voting on specified matters. The Operating Agreement can authorize certain decisions (e.g.
product feature votes, treasury allocations within a budget) to be made via on-chain token-
holder voting, while reserving fundamental decisions (mergers, amendments to the OA,
dissolution) to the LLC members’ vote to satisfy legal formalities. This hybrid governance
ensures we honor token-based community control where feasible, without running afoul of
corporate law for critical issues. Importantly, the Operating Agreement will also cover
financing and profit distributions – for example, empowering the DAO to raise capital by
selling membership interests, and outlining how and when profits may be distributed or
reinvested. (In our model, the DAO Council/contract can deploy capital to fund proposals or
“distribute profits to Members” consistent with the agreement.) Transfer restrictions,
membership withdrawal rights, and procedures for a member to dissociate (exit) the DAO will
be defined (likely requiring surrender of their membership token and forfeiture of governance
rights upon exit). By codifying these details in the Operating Agreement and smart contracts,
we ensure clarity and enforceability of everyone’s rights.
 Tax Status: By default, a Wyoming DAO LLC enjoys pass-through taxation, meaning the
entity itself is not taxed at the federal level – instead, profits or losses “pass through” to
members’ personal or corporate tax returns. This avoids double taxation on distributions.
However, our Operating Agreement will allow flexibility for the DAO to elect C-Corporation
taxation if it proves more efficient (Wyoming LLCs can choose to be taxed as a corporation).
In fact, one sample Wyoming DAO agreement explicitly “elected to be taxed as a C-
Corporation” for flexibility. We will analyze the company’s financial projections – if we
anticipate significant retained earnings (reinvested profits) that would otherwise create tax
burdens on members, a C-Corp election could shield members from phantom income (see Tax
Efficiency section for more detail). The Wyoming absence of a state income tax further
supports our choice of jurisdiction, as it minimizes state tax leakage for the entity and its
members.
In summary, the Wyoming DAO LLC structure provides a legally robust yet innovative foundation.
We will fully comply with Wyoming’s DAO law provisions: from upgradable smart contracts and
registered agents to explicit on-chain governance integration. This gives investors the assurance of an
established legal wrapper and court-recognized limited liability, while the project retains the
decentralized, automated character that will streamline operations.
AI-Driven Governance Mechanisms
At the heart of our organization is an AI-driven governance system that automates executive functions
and enforces rules via code. The goal is to replace or augment traditional management layers with
transparent, data-driven algorithms, thereby improving efficiency and reducing overhead. Below we
outline how governance and decision-making will work in our DAO:
 Smart Contract Governance: The DAO’s bylaws are encoded as smart contracts on a
blockchain (likely a reliable Layer-1 or Layer-2 network that supports secure smart contracts).
These contracts implement the core governance logic: handling proposals, votes, treasury
management, and even performance-based rules. For example, any member or authorized
token-holder might submit a proposal (to fund a project, change a protocol parameter, approve
a partnership, etc.) which then gets voted on-chain. If the required quorum and approval
threshold are met, the smart contract automatically executes the decision (e.g. releasing funds

for a project) without needing a human CEO to intermediate. This automated execution ensures
that approved decisions are carried out consistently and without delay, eliminating bureaucracy.
 AI-Augmented Decision Making: We will integrate AI agents to monitor operations and
suggest or trigger certain decisions based on predefined performance metrics. For instance, an
AI system might continuously track key performance indicators (KPIs) of the business (user
growth, revenue, model accuracy of our AI apps, etc.). If metrics fall outside acceptable ranges
or if an opportunity is detected, the AI can flag this to the DAO or even automatically draft a
proposal for corrective action. Routine management tasks – such as budget rebalancing, or
adjusting computing resources for our AI services – could be delegated to AI agents operating
under the DAO’s rules. By automating processes through smart contracts, we eliminate many
intermediaries and manual steps, thereby “reducing administrative overhead”. This lean
structure means we won’t need a large staff of supervisors or middle managers, resulting in
lower operating costs. One source notes that DAOs “eliminate the need for intermediaries,
reducing administrative overhead and minimizing human error… resulting in lower costs and
more efficient operations.”. Those savings are then available to reinvest or distribute, as per our
model.
 Performance Metric Enforcement: The governance contracts can include objective performance
criteria that, when met or missed, automatically trigger responses. For example, the DAO could
encode that “if quarterly profit exceeds $X, then Y% is automatically allocated to the R&D
fund” or “if an AI model’s accuracy drops below 90%, suspend its deployment and initiate a
review.” Smart contracts excel at this kind of rule-based enforcement. Indeed, blockchain-
based governance can enable “automated enforcement: smart contracts on the blockchain can
evaluate performance against objective metrics” and execute predetermined actions. We will
define such key performance triggers in the smart contracts to ensure the organization stays on
course without requiring constant human micromanagement. These could cover everything
from financial thresholds to software reliability metrics. Additionally, AI compliance checks
can be built in – for instance, an AI could scan proposals or transactions for compliance
(financial limits, legal/ethical constraints) and block any action that violates preset rules,
analogous to an automated compliance officer.
 Voting Mechanisms: Governance voting will likely be token-based for community-related
decisions (each governance token carries voting weight), possibly with quadratic voting or
other mechanisms to prevent plutocracy. Meanwhile, LLC members (VC equity holders) may
have voting rights on an as-needed basis for major corporate actions. We can implement a dual
voting structure: routine product and ecosystem decisions are handled by token votes (inclusive
of early users’ voice), whereas structural corporate decisions require an LLC member vote or a
combined vote. These processes will be clearly defined in the Operating Agreement and
encoded where possible. All votes and decisions are recorded on the blockchain, providing an
immutable and transparent ledger of governance actions. This transparency fosters trust: both
investors and community can verify that decisions were executed as approved, with no behind-
closed-doors manipulation.
 DAO Council and Human Oversight: While AI and smart contracts will manage day-to-day
operations, we will institute a DAO Council (a multi-signature committee or board, possibly
comprised of founding team members and elected community representatives) to provide
human oversight for critical issues. This council can have emergency powers to pause smart
contracts or override AI actions in exceptional circumstances – a safety valve to handle
unforeseen scenarios or “edge cases” where human judgment is indispensable (for example,
responding to a security breach or a severe AI malfunction). The council’s role is to ensure the
AI-governance remains aligned with the DAO’s mission and legal obligations. Importantly,
Wyoming’s framework implicitly expects some human agency for updates/upgrades, so the

council would likely be the body that enacts contract upgrades or resolves disputes outside the
scope of code. All such interventions will be governed by strict rules to prevent abuse (e.g.
requiring a supermajority of council members to take emergency action, and perhap
