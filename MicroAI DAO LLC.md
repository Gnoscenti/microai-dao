# MicroAI DAO LLC

This repository contains the smart contracts and tools for implementing MicroAI Studios as a Wyoming DAO LLC with EXECAI as a stakeholder.

## Overview

The implementation provides the minimum requirements for Wyoming DAO LLC compliance while establishing EXECAI as a legitimate stakeholder with voting rights. The system consists of:

1. **Governance Program**: Handles proposals, voting, and execution of approved decisions
2. **Membership Program**: Manages DAO members, including EXECAI as an AI stakeholder
3. **EXECAI Client**: Python interface for EXECAI to evaluate proposals and submit votes

## Prerequisites

- Rust (installed)
- Solana CLI (installed)
- Python 3.6+ (for EXECAI client)

## Smart Contracts

### Governance Program

The governance program implements the core DAO functionality:

- Creating proposals
- Voting on proposals
- Executing approved proposals
- Logging actions for transparency

### Membership Program

The membership program manages DAO members:

- Registering members (including AI stakeholders)
- Managing voting power
- Tracking member information

## Building and Deployment

### Build the Smart Contracts

```bash
# Build governance program
cd programs/governance
cargo build-bpf

# Build membership program
cd ../membership
cargo build-bpf
```

### Deploy to Solana

Use the deployment script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the smart contracts
2. Deploy them to the Solana network
3. Create necessary accounts
4. Initialize the programs
5. Register EXECAI as a member

## EXECAI Client

The EXECAI client provides an interface for EXECAI to interact with the DAO governance system:

```bash
# Configure the client
# Edit config.json with your program IDs

# Run the client
python3 scripts/execai_client.py
```

The client will:
1. Fetch active proposals
2. Evaluate each proposal using EXECAI's decision logic
3. Submit votes on behalf of EXECAI
4. Log actions for transparency

## Wyoming DAO LLC Compliance

This implementation meets the minimum requirements for Wyoming DAO LLC compliance:

1. **Articles of Organization**: The smart contracts implement the governance structure specified in the Articles.
2. **Operating Agreement**: The governance and membership programs enforce the rules defined in the Operating Agreement.
3. **Smart Contract Registration**: The deployment script registers the smart contract addresses.
4. **Member Rights**: The membership program establishes member rights, including EXECAI as an AI stakeholder.
5. **Transparent Governance**: All actions are logged on-chain for transparency.

## Security Considerations

The current implementation includes basic security features:

- Signer verification for all transactions
- Authority checks for administrative actions
- Transparent logging of all actions

For production deployment, additional security measures are recommended:

- Multi-signature wallet for administrative actions
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key management
- Regular security audits
- Zero-trust verification for all operations

## Next Steps

After implementing the minimum requirements, consider these enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Governance**: Add proposal categories and specialized voting
2. **Advanced AI Integration**: Deploy full AI model for decision-making
3. **Expanded Security**: Implement HSMs and zero-trust verification
4. **Full Ecosystem Integration**: Connect with Golden Age Academy and GoldenAgeMindset
